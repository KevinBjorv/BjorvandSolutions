        <h2 id="faq-title">Smart Indie FAQ</h2>
        <details open>
          <summary>Who is Smart Indie actually for?</summary>
          <p>Smart Indie is for beginner solo devs who have tried Unity or other engines, watched tutorials, maybe started a few projects, but never finished a game. If you are willing to follow a simple plan for 60 days and build a small, realistic game instead of your dream RPG, you are the right fit.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I need to be good at coding or art?</summary>
          <p>No. You do not need to be a “programmer”. You need basic comfort with a beginner tutorial and a willingness to experiment. Smart Indie focuses on simple mechanics, repeatable patterns, and only the skills you need to ship one small game. No advanced math or fancy shaders.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How much time do I need each week?</summary>
          <p>Most students move forward with 3 to 5 focused hours per week. The system is designed for people with school, a job, or other responsibilities. You get clear weekly targets so you always know what to do in the next short session.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Will this help if I already know coding but always quit?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Smart Indie is built around that exact problem. You will choose a tiny, finishable scope, follow a 60 day roadmap, and use accountability check points so you do not drift into new ideas or restart every few weeks.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Why pay for this instead of just watching free tutorials?</summary>
          <p>Tutorials teach you pieces of game dev. They are not a system that takes you from “I kind of know Unity” to “my game is finished and published”. Smart Indie gives you a complete roadmap, deadlines, scope rules, and support so you stop guessing what to learn next and actually ship something real.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do I need to use a specific game engine for Smart Indie?</summary>
          <p>No. Smart Indie works with any modern game engine. The system teaches you scope, planning, weekly sprints, and how to finish a small game, not how to use a specific tool. Whether you prefer Unity, Godot, Unreal, or anything else, the roadmap and finish-focused systems apply the same. You build your game in your engine while following a proven structure that keeps you out of tutorial hell and pushes you to the finish line.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What if I cannot join right now?</summary>
          <p>If you are not ready to commit to finishing a game, keep following my free content on YouTube and start applying the ideas. When you are ready to focus on one small project for 60 days and actually release it, Smart Indie will be here to guide you through that first full game.</p>
