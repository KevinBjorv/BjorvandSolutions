      <p class="hero-sub">Everything you need to know about how Smart Indie helps beginners finish and release their first game.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>What exactly is Smart Indie?</summary>
        <p>Smart Indie is a step-by-step video program with a community and direct access to me, built to take a beginner from “stuck in tutorial hell” to a finished, released first game without guessing what to do next.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Who is Smart Indie for (and not for)?</summary>
        <p>It’s for beginners who have tried learning a bit but feel stuck, overwhelmed, or directionless and want a clear path to ship. It’s not for advanced devs, people trying to build an AAA-sized game, or people who only want theory instead of building.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What do you mean by “finish and release a game”?</summary>
        <p>It means you publish a real itch.io store page and a playable build with a core game loop, so you have an actual released game, not another unfinished prototype.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Which game engine does Smart Indie work for?</summary>
        <p>The framework works for any engine, and I help you choose the one that fits you best. When I show examples or walkthroughs, I’ll use Unity so it stays clear and practical.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How does the 60-day guarantee work?</summary>
        <p>If you follow the framework, complete the steps, and follow both the “How to follow the path” guide and the “How to learn effectively” guide, you’re covered by the 60-day release guarantee.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How much time do I need each week to get results?</summary>
        <p>Plan for at least 6 to 9 hours per week, because consistency beats motivation and the program is built around momentum, not binge-learning.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What support do I actually get after joining?</summary>
        <p>You get the full video path, the community, personal DMs with me, plus a beta test from me with a short feedback video so you don’t build in the dark.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I get lifetime access and future updates?</summary>
        <p>Yes, it’s a one-time payment with lifetime access and all future updates included, and you don’t need an upsell to succeed, but 1-on-1 coaching is available for students who want advanced help.</p>
