      <p class="hero-sub">Everything you need to know about how Smart Indie helps beginners finish and release their first game.</p>

      <details open>
        <summary>What exactly is Smart Indie?</summary>
        <p>Smart Indie is a structured video program with community support and direct feedback from me that walks beginner solo game developers from “stuck in tutorial hell” to launching a real first game. Every step is laid out so you know what to do, when to do it, and how to avoid the mistakes that stall most new creators.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Who is Smart Indie for (and not for)?</summary>
        <p>Smart Indie is designed for beginners and early-stage indie developers who feel overwhelmed, need accountability, and want a clear release path. It’s not the right fit for advanced devs aiming for AAA scope or for anyone looking for theory without building and shipping.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What do you mean by “finish and release a game”?</summary>
        <p>“Finish and release” means you ship a playable build with a core game loop and publish a live itch.io store page, so you have a completed first game in the wild instead of another half-finished prototype. The program guides you through the production, polishing, and launch steps to get there.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Which game engine does Smart Indie work for?</summary>
        <p>The framework works with any engine. I help you choose the best fit, and I demonstrate the lessons in Unity to keep the examples practical for most beginners.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How does the 60-day guarantee work?</summary>
        <p>If you follow the framework, complete the assignments, and use both the “How to follow the path” and “How to learn effectively” guides, you’re protected by a 60-day release guarantee. I’ll coach you through blockers so you can launch on time, and if you don’t release, you get your money back.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How much time do I need each week to get results?</summary>
        <p>Plan for 6 to 9 focused hours per week. The curriculum is built around momentum, so short, consistent work sessions compound faster than binge-learning and keep your game moving toward release.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What support do I actually get after joining?</summary>
        <p>You get the full video curriculum, the Smart Indie community, personal DMs with me, and a beta test review with a short feedback video so you always know what to improve next instead of building in the dark.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do I get lifetime access and future updates?</summary>
        <p>Yes. Smart Indie is a one-time payment that includes lifetime access, all future updates, and optional 1-on-1 coaching for students who want deeper help. There are no surprise upsells required to succeed.</p>
