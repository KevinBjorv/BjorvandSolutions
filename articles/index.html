        <p class="article-tag">Article 1</p>
        <h2 id="tutorial-hell-title">How I Escaped “Tutorial Hell” in Game Development (and You Can Too)</h2>
        <p>I used to treat game dev tutorials like Netflix. One more video, then I’ll “start building.” Except I never started. I just got better at recognizing code, not writing it.</p>
        <p>If you’re stuck in tutorial hell, it usually looks like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You “know” how movement works… until you try to do it alone.</li>
          <li>You feel busy, but you’re not getting closer to a finished game.</li>
          <li>You don’t know the “what next” step, so you default back to another tutorial.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>The real problem: recognition feels like progress</h3>
        <p>Tutorials create a comfort loop: you recognize what’s happening, your brain gives you a little “I’m learning” reward… and then the moment you’re alone in Unity, you freeze.</p>
        <p>This is why so many beginners feel directionless after they learn the basics. You didn’t fail. You just trained the wrong skill. You trained recognition, not building.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>My anti-tutorial hell system (simple rules, no philosophy)</h3>
        <h4>Rule 1: I don’t “watch tutorials.” I solve problems.</h4>
        <p>If I can’t name the problem I’m trying to solve, I’m not allowed to open YouTube.</p>
        <p>Instead, I write one sentence:</p>
        <blockquote>“I need to make the player move with WASD and collide properly.”</blockquote>
        <p>That sentence becomes my mission. Then tutorials are allowed, but only as a tool, not as a course.</p>
        <h4>Rule 2: 15 minutes of struggle before I search 🔥</h4>
        <p>I give myself 15 minutes to try. Not 2 hours. Not 10 seconds.</p>
        <p>Why 15? Because struggle creates a map of what I don’t know. Without that map, searching becomes random doomscrolling.</p>
        <h4>Rule 3: 5 minutes max of tutorial, then I close it</h4>
        <p>I watch just enough to unblock myself, then I close it and rebuild from memory.</p>
        <p>If I can’t rebuild it, I didn’t learn it. I just witnessed it.</p>
        <p>This is where real skill forms: build → break → debug → repeat.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The “Tiny Sandbox” project that fixes your brain</h3>
        <h4>A sandbox that takes 1–3 days, not 3 months</h4>
        <p>Pick one tiny thing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a door that opens with a key</li>
          <li>a basic enemy that chases you</li>
          <li>a UI health bar that updates correctly</li>
          <li>a simple pickup system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s it. No story. No inventory. No crafting. No “later I’ll add…”</p>
        <p>When I’m working on my own Unity projects (even bigger ones like a horror prototype), I still return to this mini-project mindset because it keeps momentum alive.</p>
        <h4>The weird part: “confusion” becomes a good sign</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If it’s confusing, I’m finally learning.</li>
          <li>If it’s comfortable, I’m probably just consuming.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That mindset shift is the exit door.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>A quick checklist to know you’re out of tutorial hell ✅</h3>
        <h4>You’re out when:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You can start a new Unity project without a video playing.</li>
          <li>You can Google one specific error and understand the fix.</li>
          <li>You can rebuild a system you made last week (even if it’s ugly).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>You’re still in when:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You can’t work unless someone tells you the next click.</li>
          <li>You keep restarting “beginner Unity” playlists.</li>
          <li>You collect frameworks instead of finishing small games.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="article-tag">Article 2</p>
        <h2 id="unity-version-control-title">Unity Version Control for Beginners: The Simple Git Setup That Saves Your Game</h2>
        <p>Most beginners learn version control after they get burned.</p>
        <p>I learned it the fun way: by losing progress, breaking something that used to work, and realizing I had no clean way back.</p>
        <p>Version control sounds like “team stuff.” It isn’t. It’s a solo dev survival tool.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What version control actually does (in human language)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I can rewind my project to yesterday.</li>
          <li>I can try risky changes without fear.</li>
          <li>I can stop making “FINAL_FINAL_v7” folders.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you’re building games in Unity, you need this. Even if you’re alone. Especially if you’re alone.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The beginner fear: “Git is too complicated”</h3>
        <p>Git can get complicated. But your setup does not need to be.</p>
        <p>You only need to learn <strong>three actions</strong> at the start:</p>
        <h4>1) Commit</h4>
        <p>A “save point” with a message.</p>
        <h4>2) Push</h4>
        <p>Backup to GitHub (or another remote).</p>
        <h4>3) Pull</h4>
        <p>Download the latest version to your PC.</p>
        <p>That’s enough to protect your project while you learn the rest gradually.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>My minimal Unity + Git setup (the exact steps I recommend)</h3>
        <h4>Step 1: Create a new repo (GitHub or local)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a repository for your Unity project.</li>
          <li>Put it in the same folder as your project (or initialize inside the project folder).</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step 2: Add a proper Unity <code>.gitignore</code></h4>
        <p>Unity generates tons of files you do not want to track.</p>
        <p>If you commit everything, Git becomes slow, messy, and annoying. A Unity-specific <code>.gitignore</code> fixes that.</p>
        <h4>Step 3: Use Git LFS for large files (important)</h4>
        <p>Unity projects include large binary files (textures, audio, models). Git struggles with that.</p>
        <p>Git LFS (Large File Storage) handles big files cleanly so your repo doesn’t explode.</p>
        <h4>Step 4: Make “small commits” with boring messages</h4>
        <p>I know people want cool commit messages. Don’t.</p>
        <p>Use simple ones:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Player movement working</code></li>
          <li><code>Fix enemy pathing bug</code></li>
          <li><code>Add main menu UI</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Small commits are easy to undo. Big commits are fear.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The “I’m a beginner” workflow that actually works</h3>
        <h4>Daily workflow (solo dev)</h4>
        <h5>Morning</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Pull (if you work on multiple PCs)</li>
          <li>Make changes</li>
          <li>Commit when something works</li>
          <li>Push</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>End of session</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Commit + push again</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you do this, you basically stop fearing Unity experiments. You get your confidence back.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Common Unity version control mistakes (that waste weeks)</h3>
        <h4>Mistake 1: Waiting until the game is “serious”</h4>
        <p>If you wait, you’ll eventually hit a project-breaking moment… and you’ll wish you started earlier.</p>
        <h4>Mistake 2: Committing random generated folders</h4>
        <p>This makes your repo huge and causes weird merge issues.</p>
        <h4>Mistake 3: No LFS, then your repo becomes pain</h4>
        <p>You’ll feel it when pushes get slow and cloning takes forever.</p>

          <div>
            <h3>CTA: Smart Indie</h3>
            <p>Inside SmartIndie, I treat version control as part of the “finish and release” skill, not a side quest. I want beginners to ship games without the constant fear of breaking everything. Version control is one of the simplest ways to make that real.</p>

        <p class="article-tag">Article 3</p>
        <h2 id="scope-creep-title">Scope Creep in Indie Games: My “Core Loop Test” to Stop Feature Creep Fast</h2>
        <p>Scope creep is when your game quietly turns into a 3-year prison.</p>
        <p>It usually starts innocent:</p>
        <p>“I’ll just add a stamina system.”</p>
        <p>Then:</p>
        <p>“Okay but crafting would make it deeper.”</p>
        <p>Then:</p>
        <p>“Wait, what if it’s open world?”</p>
        <p>And now you’re building Skyrim alone. 🧠</p>
        <p>If you’re a beginner trying to finish your first game, scope creep is the number one silent killer.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why scope creep hits beginners so hard</h3>
        <p>From what I’ve seen (and from what beginners tell me), the pattern is consistent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You want to finish and publish something, not just learn endlessly.</li>
          <li>You get overwhelmed early and overscope.</li>
          <li>You lose momentum because there’s no structure.</li>
          <li>You feel guilty about cutting features, like you’re “ruining” your dream game.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s normal beginner psychology. But you still need a system that protects you from your own imagination.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The Core Loop Test (one sentence that saves months)</h3>
        <p>Here’s my test:</p>
        <h4>If I can’t describe the fun in one sentence, the scope is already broken.</h4>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Dodge threats using sonar pings while navigating a dark maze.”</li>
          <li>“Stack upgrades to move faster and chase a high score.”</li>
          <li>“Survive waves by building traps and repositioning.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That one sentence becomes a filter.</p>
        <p>If a feature does not improve that sentence, it gets cut.</p>
        <p>This is the closest thing to a cheat code I know for avoiding feature creep.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>My 3-box method: MUST / NICE / LATER</h3>
        <p>This is how I plan beginner projects so they actually get finished.</p>
        <h4>Box 1: MUST (ship-worthy)</h4>
        <p>These are the minimum parts required for a real game:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>start menu</li>
          <li>win or lose condition</li>
          <li>one complete loop (core loop)</li>
          <li>basic sound + feedback</li>
          <li>a build you can share</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Box 2: NICE (only if time remains)</h4>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>extra enemy type</li>
          <li>better UI polish</li>
          <li>more levels</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Box 3: LATER (fantasy land)</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>crafting</li>
          <li>skill trees</li>
          <li>online multiplayer</li>
          <li>procedural generation</li>
          <li>“just one more biome”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key rule:</p>
        <blockquote>Anything in LATER is not allowed to move up until the MUST box is done.</blockquote>
        <p>Write it somewhere visible. This is you vs your future self.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>The 80/20 skill rule that stops impossible projects</h3>
        <h4>I only pick game ideas where I already know how to do ~80% of it</h4>
        <p>The remaining 20% becomes the learning zone.</p>
        <p>If it’s 50/50, you’ll stall constantly. Your project becomes one long panic Google session.</p>
        <p>This is how you choose an idea that finishes, instead of an idea that teaches you pain.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>“Add it later” is not a lie. It’s a weapon.</h3>
        <p>A lot of beginners think cutting features means giving up.</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>Cutting features means you get to release a real game, then build the next one with more skill.</p>
        <p>Finishing your first game is what turns you into a real game developer. It’s identity. It’s momentum. It’s proof.</p>
