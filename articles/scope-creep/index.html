        <h1 id="scope-creep-title">Scope Creep in Indie Games: How I Stop Feature Creep Before It Kills the Project</h1>
        <p>Scope creep is when your game quietly turns into a long-term prison. It usually starts with something that sounds harmless: “I’ll just add a stamina system.” Then it becomes crafting, then a skill tree, then five enemy types, then a storyline, then a polished inventory UI. And suddenly the game you were supposed to finish in a month becomes a project you avoid opening.</p>
        <p>If you’re trying to finish your first game, scope creep is one of the biggest reasons you won’t. Not because you’re weak, but because your brain is doing what it’s supposed to do: it’s trying to make the game better. The problem is that “better” usually means “bigger,” and bigger is what makes beginners quit.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Why scope creep happens (especially to beginners)</h2>
        <p>Beginners often have two problems at the same time:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>You want the game to be good.</li>
          <li>You don’t yet have a strong feeling for how long things take.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So you choose an idea, start building, and then you keep adding “small” features that don’t feel small once you actually implement them. Each feature is another system, another set of bugs, another set of decisions. The project gets heavier, and your motivation starts leaking.</p>
        <p>I’ve seen this pattern a lot, and I’ve done it myself. The first sign is usually this feeling: “I’m working, but I’m not getting closer to something playable.” That’s the moment you need a scope rule.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Core Loop Test (my favorite way to cut features)</h2>
        <p>Here’s the simplest test I know:</p>
        <p><strong>If you can’t describe the fun in one sentence, your scope is already broken.</strong></p>
        <p>Your core loop sentence should be something like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Dodge threats using sonar pings while navigating a dark maze.”</li>
          <li>“Move fast, collect upgrades, and chase a high score.”</li>
          <li>“Survive waves by repositioning and using simple tools.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This sentence is not marketing. It’s a filter. Every feature has to earn its place by improving that sentence. If it doesn’t make the core loop more fun, clearer, or easier to feel, it gets cut.</p>
        <p>That one sentence can save you months because it stops you from adding features “just because.”</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The simple planning method that keeps projects finishable</h2>
        <p>When I plan a beginner project, I split features into three buckets:</p>
        <h3>Must (the game can ship with only this)</h3>
        <p>This is the minimum version that still counts as a real game. For most beginner games, it’s things like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a playable core loop</li>
          <li>a win or lose condition (or a clear end)</li>
          <li>a start menu or restart flow</li>
          <li>basic sound or feedback so it doesn’t feel dead</li>
          <li>a build you can send to someone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you finish only this, you still win. You shipped.</p>
        <h3>Nice (only if the Must list is done early)</h3>
        <p>These are upgrades that improve the experience but aren’t required to release:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>one extra enemy type</li>
          <li>better UI</li>
          <li>more levels or variations</li>
          <li>extra polish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Later (danger zone)</h3>
        <p>This is where projects go to die. These are features that are cool but expensive:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>crafting</li>
          <li>skill trees</li>
          <li>procedural generation</li>
          <li>open world anything</li>
          <li>online multiplayer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rule that matters is this: nothing moves out of “Later” until the “Must” version is complete and playable.</p>
        <p>This removes the constant decision fatigue. You don’t have to debate every idea. You just park it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The best “first game” rule I’ve ever used</h2>
        <p>Here’s a rule that I think beginners need to hear clearly:</p>
        <p><strong>Your first game should be chosen for one thing: it must be realistic to finish.</strong></p>
        <p>This is where a lot of people misunderstand the 80/20 idea. I like the 80/20 skill rule for the first game specifically, because the first win is everything. Your first game should mostly be made from skills you already have, with a small amount of new learning. That keeps it finishable.</p>
        <p>But that rule is for the first game, not every game forever.</p>
        <p>After you’ve shipped something, you can take bigger swings. You’ll have more confidence, better instincts, and more proof that you can finish. But for the first game, the goal is not “my dream game.” The goal is “a real finished game that proves I can ship.”</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>A practical way to stop scope creep mid-project</h2>
        <p>If you’re already deep in a project and it’s getting too big, here’s what I do:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write the core loop sentence.</li>
          <li>Make a “Must” list that creates a playable version in the smallest way possible.</li>
          <li>Cut or postpone anything that doesn’t help you reach that playable version.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This can feel painful because it feels like giving up. It’s not giving up. It’s trading fantasy progress for real progress.</p>
        <p>Because shipping a small game teaches you more than half-building a big one.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>How to know your scope is healthy</h2>
        <p>Your scope is probably healthy if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>you can describe the game in one sentence without adding a paragraph</li>
          <li>you have a short Must list and a long Later list</li>
          <li>you can imagine a playable build within a couple of weeks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your scope is probably unhealthy if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>your feature list keeps growing every day</li>
          <li>you keep redesigning systems instead of completing one loop</li>
          <li>you can’t picture what “done” looks like</li>
        </ul>
