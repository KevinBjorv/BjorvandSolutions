        <h1 id="tutorial-hell-title">How I Escaped Tutorial Hell in Game Development (and How You Can Too)</h1>
        <p>I used to “learn game dev” in the most common way: I watched tutorials, followed along, and felt productive. Then I would close Unity and realize I still couldn’t build anything without a video holding my hand.</p>
        <p>That loop is what people call tutorial hell. It’s not that you’re lazy or dumb. It’s that tutorials are designed to be smooth. They remove the hard parts, the mistakes, and the decision-making. So you get great at recognizing what to do, but you don’t build the skill of figuring out what to do.</p>
        <h2>Why tutorials feel like progress (even when they’re not)</h2>
        <p>When you watch a tutorial, your brain gets quick wins. You understand the instructor, the code compiles, and things move on screen. That feels like learning, and technically it is, but it’s a specific type: recognition. Recognition is when you can look at something and think, “Yeah, I’ve seen that before.”</p>
        <p>Building a game requires a different skill: recall and problem solving. That’s when you can sit down with a blank script and make choices. What variables do I need? What should this function return? Where do I put this logic? Tutorials don’t train that unless you force them to.</p>
        <p>I noticed this in my own projects. Even when I knew the basics, I would hesitate on the simplest systems because I wasn’t used to making decisions alone. The fix wasn’t “more tutorials.” The fix was a different way of using them.</p>
        <h2>The mindset shift that actually got me out</h2>
        <p>I stopped thinking “I’m going to learn Unity today” and started thinking “I’m going to solve one problem today.” That sounds small, but it changes everything. Instead of opening YouTube and browsing, I write one clear sentence first:</p>
        <blockquote>I want the player to move and collide correctly.</blockquote>
        <p>Now I have a target. If I get stuck, I can search for the exact thing I need. Without that target, tutorials become entertainment that looks like work.</p>
        <h2>The simple system I use now</h2>
        <p>Here’s what actually works for beginners, and it’s what I wish someone forced me to do earlier.</p>
        <p>First, I try on my own for a short time before searching. Not hours. Not ten seconds. I usually do around 10 to 15 minutes. The point is not to magically solve it. The point is to discover what you don’t understand. That gives you better questions to search for.</p>
        <p>Second, if I watch a tutorial, I don’t “follow along” from start to finish. I watch only enough to unblock myself, then I close it and rebuild from memory. If I can’t rebuild it, I didn’t learn it. I only copied it. Rebuilding is where the learning happens.</p>
        <p>Third, I keep the project tiny on purpose. Most beginners fail because they pick a “dream game” and then drown in systems. Instead, I build a tiny sandbox that takes one to three days. One mechanic. One loop. Nothing extra.</p>
        <p>A good tiny sandbox project could be something like: a key opens a door, a simple enemy chases you, a basic health bar updates, or a pickup disappears and increments a counter. This might sound boring, but it trains the exact skills that transfer to bigger games.</p>
        <h2>The weird truth: confusion is a good sign</h2>
        <p>When you’ve relied on tutorials, confusion feels like you’re doing something wrong. But confusion is the feeling of your brain building new connections. If you never feel confused, you’re probably staying in the “recognition” comfort zone.</p>
        <p>So my rule is simple: if I’m a bit confused but still moving forward, I’m learning. If everything feels easy and smooth, I might just be consuming.</p>
        <h2>How to tell if you’re escaping tutorial hell</h2>
        <p>You’re getting out when you can start a new project without needing a video immediately, when you can Google one specific error and understand the fix, and when you can rebuild something you made last week without copying it.</p>
        <p>You’re still stuck when you can’t work unless someone tells you the next click, when you keep restarting beginner playlists, and when your main progress is collecting resources instead of building small finished systems.</p>
