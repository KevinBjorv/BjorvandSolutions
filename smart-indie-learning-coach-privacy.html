      <p class="hero-sub" style="max-width: 800px;">This page explains how the Smart Indie Learning Coach custom GPT chatbot (the "Service") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use it.</p>
      <div class="card" style="max-width: 960px; margin-top: 24px;">

        <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 31, 2025.</p>

        <h2 id="overview-title">Overview</h2>
        <p>The Service is designed to coach learning through active learning and guided practice.</p>

        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>The Service is operated by Bjorvand Solutions ("we," "us," "our"). If you are publishing this under a different legal entity, replace this name everywhere it appears.</p>

        <h3>Information we collect</h3>
        <p>When you use the Service, we may collect information you provide directly, such as messages, prompts, code snippets, project notes, learning goals, and feedback you type into the chat. We may also collect basic technical information needed to operate the Service, such as device and browser type, app version, language, approximate location derived from IP address, and diagnostic logs.</p>
        <p>If the Service supports accounts, we may collect account identifiers such as email address, username, and authentication metadata. If payments are involved, payment processing is handled by a payment provider, and we do not store full payment card details.</p>

        <h3>How we use information</h3>
        <p>We use information to provide and improve the Service, including generating responses, saving your preferences if enabled, troubleshooting errors, preventing abuse, and measuring performance. We may use conversation content to support features such as session continuity, personalization, or quality improvements, depending on how the Service is configured.</p>
        <p>We do not use your content for advertising profiles, and we do not sell your personal information.</p>

        <h3>AI processing and user content</h3>
        <p>The Service processes your inputs to produce coaching responses. Because the Service is built to enforce learning and retention, your messages may include technical material such as code and debugging details. You should avoid entering sensitive personal information into the chat. If you choose to share sensitive information, you do so at your own discretion, and it may be processed as part of providing the Service.</p>

        <h3>Sharing of information</h3>
        <p>We may share information with service providers that help us run the Service, such as hosting, analytics, error monitoring, authentication, customer support, and payment processing. These providers are permitted to process data only to perform services for us and must protect it.</p>
        <p>We may also share information if required by law, to respond to lawful requests, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of users, the public, or the Service.</p>

        <h3>Data retention</h3>
        <p>We retain information only as long as needed to operate the Service and for legitimate business purposes such as security, dispute resolution, and compliance. If conversation history or saved learning progress is a feature, we retain it until you delete it or close your account, unless retention is required for legal or security reasons.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No system is perfectly secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h3>Your rights and choices</h3>
        <p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information, subject to applicable law and operational constraints. If the Service offers account settings for data export, chat history deletion, or opt-outs, you can use those controls where available. If you want to make a request directly, contact us using the details below.</p>

        <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
        <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us so we can take appropriate steps.</p>

        <h3>International data transfers</h3>
        <p>If you access the Service from outside the country where our servers or service providers are located, your information may be processed in other countries that may have different data protection laws. We take steps designed to ensure appropriate protections for such transfers where required.</p>

        <h3>Third-party links and services</h3>
        <p>The Service may link to third-party sites or integrate third-party tools. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies, and we are not responsible for those practices.</p>

        <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date and may provide additional notice within the Service. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
